# Bug fixes

  - add item issue: when moving in a direction that is clean, it still adds a new item to the game
  - item colors become black, when item grows up, it should be more wormer, but it should not become solid black or any unreadble color

# Ideas

- Make setting UI
- make settings for default key bindings
- add score system
- Implement multiple bindings keys
